# Practice-React-Networking-System
This is a mock, front-end, account system, currently a work in progress, that I am creating to better learn and adapt my existing JavaScript programming skills to the React JavaScript framework. It includes login, account, and mock client-side session scheduling systems, as well as various forms for changing account or networking settings.
