# Practice-React-Networking-System

# DESCRIPTION: 
This is a mock, front-end, account system, currently a work in progress, that I am creating to better learn and adapt my existing JavaScript programming skills to the React JavaScript framework. It includes login, account, and mock client-side session scheduling systems, as well as various forms for changing account or networking settings.

I have included two versions of my project's source code in this repository:

The version inside the "src" folder has not had any NPM/NPX production compilation commands ran on it. It does not include any core React.js or Babel dependencies inside of it, so any web pages from the project must be viewed by first creating a new React project and then importing the "src" folder into the root directory of that new project. It also does not have any default polyfilling or minification inside of it. I recommend using this version for reading my code as I have originally written it. 

The version inside of the "build" folder contains an optimized, minified, compiled, and production-ready build of the React JavaScript source code I have written so far, including the Components, classes, and CSS stylesheets from the "src" folder. The web pages of the networking and account system are viewable by first downloading a copy of the "build" folder and then opening the "index.html" file inside of it with a modern Internet browser. This version does not require that a new React project first be created and then the "src" or "build" folder be imported into it. This is the version I recommend using for viewing and interacting with the web pages of the account and networking system.

The project is mostly written using ES6 JavaScript syntax, although I do include some backups for legacy APIs. The source code could be further backwards-transpiled to ES5 syntax for older browsers, like Internet Explorer 11, using Babel.
